# GLEngine

GLEngine was originally a bit of a learning project. It was meant to be an okay game engine with graphical capabilities and a couple others. It, as most educational projects do, turned into an absolute mess that I now despise.

Needless to say, I replaced it. GLEngine will no longer be updated, and has effectively been replaced by the far superior BARE2D Engine.
